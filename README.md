4 Foundational Agentic AI Design Patterns Every Builder Should Know

This repo accompanies the blog post that breaks down four key patterns in agentic AI system design—each inspired by how humans solve problems, and powered by practical code.

Together, these four patterns form the mnemonic:

🟥 Red Turtles Paint Murals = Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, Multi-Agent Systems

🔧 What's Inside
Each .py file corresponds to one of the patterns (or a sub-pattern) discussed in the blog:

Pattern	File	Description
🧠 Reflection	Reflection.py	Self-evaluating agents that revise their own outputs
🛠 Tool Use	ToolUse.py	Agents that use tools like search, math, and APIs
🧩 Planning	PlanningAndReasoning.py	Agents that break down tasks before executing
🤝 Multi-Agent Systems	Multi-Sequential.py, Multi-Hierarchical.py, Multi-Parallel.py, Multi-Asynchronous.py	Four styles of agent collaboration and delegation

🧠 Why It Matters
Monolithic agents only get you so far. These patterns let you:

Build smarter workflows

Structure more capable AI agents

Improve scalability, maintainability, and reliability of LLM-powered systems

🚀 Try It Out
Each file is self-contained and runnable. Just clone the repo and run any .py file using:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Multi-Sequential.py
You'll need an OpenAI key or LangChain setup (where relevant).
